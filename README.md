# Promoted Bot
A stats and team management Discord bot for Battlefield Friends: Polska

This bot uses a Battlefield 3 / 4 server's database created <a href="https://github.com/AdKats/AdKats">AdKats admin plugin</a>. It can display in a embed message stats of any player in the database as well as change Discord user's voice channel depening on what team are they in-game. Due to the plugin being exclusive to Battlefield Friends: Polska's server, it has *no multiple-server capabilities* and has some things set as constant in the code.
**Warning:** 
This repo is an upload of existing code. I wanted to stash it here to work on it in the future, but thought it was stupid to leave it laying on my disk.
